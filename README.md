# Kinematics visualization

This repository contains jupyter notebooks with visualization variables an vectors, aimed at first semester undergraduate students in physics/engineering.

The repositories are available to be used online through mybinder sites:

## Running the visualizations

You can run the visualitzations directly in your web browser from the internet, without installing anything in your computer/device, by accessing the online binder notebooks at

## Downloading the notebooks

Note that the changes that you make to the notebooks are non-permanent.
Each time you start a session, it starts with the bare notebook, as published.
Sometimes, if you leave your notebook inactive for a large time period, it will timeout and you will lose your changes.

If you want to keep your changes, you can download the notebook from the menu provided in binder to keep a local copy in your computer/device.
